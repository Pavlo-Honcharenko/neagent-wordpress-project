## Technical Responsibilities

From a technical perspective, I handled:

- Full front-end development (HTML / CSS / JS)
- WordPress integration
- HivePress and ListingHive configuration
- XML feed parsing and automated listing imports
- Custom Gutenberg blocks development
- Complete SEO optimization
- Performance optimization
- Security configuration
- Hosting migration
- Ongoing administration and maintenance

For this project, I intentionally avoided ACF and built page structures entirely with native Gutenberg, extending it with custom blocks when required. This approach ensured better long-term maintainability and reduced plugin dependency.

Basic accessibility improvements were implemented following WCAG principles, without using a dedicated accessibility plugin.
